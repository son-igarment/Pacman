  // right order, subtle bugs can occur. Make sure that the order of systems is
  // easy to see (i.e. not hidden away by some abstraction that sets the order
  // for you). Always think carefully about the order that systems should be in.

  // It's OK to keep some game state outside of the ECS (e.g. maze, dots,
  // dotSprite) but try to keep as much state within the ECS as you can.
  // Keeping too much state outside of the ECS can lead to problems.
  // For example: `dots` is the amount of dots eaten by the player. If there
  // were more than one player, then each player might want to keep track of how
  // many dots they've eaten. So `dots` would have to be moved into a component
